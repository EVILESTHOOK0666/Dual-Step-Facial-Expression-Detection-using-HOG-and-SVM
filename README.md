# Dual-Step Facial Expression Detection using HOG and SVM

This project focuses on using the Histogranm of oriented gradients(HOG) and fisher faces algorithm to identify seven facial expressions.
The Dual step approach uses the fisher's algorithm for more distinguishable emotions like happy and sad while we use HOG for emotions like fear,anger,disgust.The overall result is more accuracy with less detection time.
